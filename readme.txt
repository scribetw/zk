!!ZK is a highly productive Java framework for building amazing enterprise web
and mobile applications.

Simply Java

    ZK is renowned for its "Ajax without JavaScript" approach since 2005,
    enabling developers to build rich internet applications transparently
    without any knowledge of Ajax and JavaScript.

    The client engine and update engine in ZK play the roles of pitcher and
    catcher, rendering Ajax communication transparent to developers. Events
    triggered by users are encapsulated and marshalled to event listeners
    running at the server.

    User interface rendered on browsers are surrogated on the server as
    POJO components, alternation made on the POJO components are reflected
    to the client transparently.

    With programs executed at the server, developers can leverage all the Java
    technologies, such as Java EE and Spring, while back-end data and services
    are readily available.


Server+client Fusion

    ZK's Server+client Fusion gives developers the freedom to leverage the best
    of both sides.

    The server-centric solution to Ajax brings a productivity boost, robustness,
    and security to Web application development; while client side solutions
    endows Web applications with greater controllability and the ability to
    leverage client side resources.

    ZK marries the benefits of both to bring forth a developer-centric approach
    where developers continue to build large scale enterprise applications with
    all the robustness of Java technologies, but also are offered the flexibility
    to work directly with ZK's jQuery based widgets to further enhance user
    experience.
